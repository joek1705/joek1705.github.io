                <p>
                    My name is Jonathan Ek and I am a swedish man living in Sundsvall, Sweden. 
                    I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. In 2020 I graduated from Mid Sweden University with a BSc in computer engineering.
                    During my BSc studies I've made some good friends and encountered some interesting fields of study. The courses that I was particularly interested
                    in include cryptography, data structures and algorithms, computer security and computer networking. My main interests mostly involve
                    development of computer software that rely heavily on being connected. Examples of such systems are the traditional client-server systems that
                    form the World Wide Web to IOT-systems. Currently I mostly focus on Web Systems.
