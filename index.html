                <p>
                    My name is Jonathan Ek and I am a swedish man living in Sundsvall, Sweden. 
                    I've been interested in computers for as long as I can remember. I am particularly interested how their construction relates to the 
                    theoretical disciplines of computer science and mathematics. In 2020 I gratuated from Mid Sweden University with a BSc in computer engineering.
                    During my BSc studies I've met some good friends and encountered some interesting fields of study. The courses that I was particularly interested
                    in include cryptography, data structures and algorithms, computer security and computer networking. For the autumn of 2020 I've been accepted
                    to a MSc programme in computer engineering at Mid Sweden University. This is a two-year-long educational programme that I will attend with the hopes
                    of expanding my knowledge in the fields of computer networking and computer systems. Thereafter I intend to work as an IT-consultant and software developer.
