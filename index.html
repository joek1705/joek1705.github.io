           <p>Hello, and welcome to my website. My name is Jonathan Ek and I am a technology enthusiast and computer programmer.
            The main purpose of this website is to present myself to the world. In 2017 I moved from GÃ¤llivare in the north of Sweden to Sundsvall
            to study computer engineering. In 2020 I graduated with a bachelors degree in computer engineering and I am now currently looking for a full-time job as a programmer.
            If you or anyone you know has any IT-related projects in mind please contact me if you think that I would be a valuable asset.
            I also plan to start a blog where I document my journey as a software developer so look forward to that.</p>
