                <h2>On the problem of IT-companies having no idea what students and fresh graduates are capable of</h2>
                <p>
                    I am a fresh graduate of computer engineering as you(the reader) might be aware of. During my studies and now when trying to find a job I have
                    observed that employers generally have no idea what students and people in my situation are capable of. The most common way of contact between 
                    IT-students and potential employers are various events where the companies get to show themselves and talk to students. Here the companies get to present
                    what their organisations do and what kind of competences they're looking for. Students, on the other hand, get to listen to the company representatives
                    and maybe they feel that they are competent enough(due to their studies) to work for their company of interest. The company representatives have to take
                    the students' words as true unless the potential employee can show something they've created. Another way for students to gain the competence required
                    for work in the IT-business is to partake in the various internships provided. From the point of view of the ambitious students these internships are either
                    inaccessible, unheard of, or overlooked because of the heavy burden of school work and expectation to work on personal projects in their spare time.
                    <br><br>
                    So, for most ambitious students the only way to really show that you're competent within your field of study is to do well in school and work on personal projects
                    in your spare time. Currently there are various websites where anyone can demonstrate coding ability by solving trivial algorithmic problems. For the
                    ambitious computing student these websites are of little interest because they're essentially a repetition of what they've been taught in school
                    (any computing degree should include atleast one course in datastructures and algorithms). Moreover, they're not useful for demonstrating coding ability
                    since the problems solved are of such nature that one writes code to solve the problem, only to never look at said code again. What is needed is a website 
                    where aspiring programmers and IT-professionals can share their personal projects with their fellow programmers and recruiters. This will help both people
                    looking for jobs and recruiters to recruit people that have demonstrated that they know their stuff. On such a website programmers will be able to critique others'
                    code and receive critique on their own code. This will allow programmers to improve their ability of reading code that someone else has written. Moreover, programmers
                    should be able to team up with other programmers such as to show that they can develop software in groups. Recruiters will benefit from this in that they can
                    easily find out if a candidate has the social as well as technical capabilites required for a software developer. 
                    Such a website is one that I will work on creating in the foreseeable future.
