                <h2>My BSc Thesis</h2>
                <p>I do in fact have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and my bachelor's thesis
                    involved solving some problems I and a fellow student had experienced with the system for
                    making study-room reservations at Mid Sweden University. It was in fact that said student's idea
                    to perform this project and I was asked to participate. This was quite an extensive project despite us working in a pair
                    but we did succeed. The project involved conducting a survey to find out how users of said system perceive it. 
                    We also created mockups of possible user interfaces that were evaluated by usability testing and wrote code in Java to
                    demonstrate the programmatic solutions we created.<a class = "center-card-anchor" href = "b_thesis.pdf"> Anyone that is interested in this project
