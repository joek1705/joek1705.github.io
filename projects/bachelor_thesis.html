            <p>I do in fact have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering and my bachelor's thesis
               involved solving some problems I and a fellow student had experienced with the system for
               making study-room reservations at Mid Sweden University. It was in fact that said student's idea
               to perform this project and I was asked to participate. This was quite an extensive project despite us working in a pair
               but we did succeed. The project involved conducting a survey to find out how users of said system perceive it. 
               We also created mockups of possible user interfaces that were evaluated by usability testing and wrote code in Java to
               demonstrate the programmatic solutions we created.<a class = "center-card-anchor" href = "b_thesis.pdf"> Anyone that is interested in this project
               may take a look at our report(written in swedish).</a>
