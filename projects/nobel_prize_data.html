                <h1>Nobel Prize Open Data</h1>
                <p>
                    This is an ongoing project wherein I intend to experiment with open data provided by
                    the <a href = "https://www.nobelprize.org/about/developer-zone-2/">Nobel Prize's open data source.</a> The intention of this experimentation is to
                    practice working with open data to gain knowledge for future projects involving open data. These
                    future projects will involve creation of a networked software system that incorporates open data from several
                    sources. This future system has the intention of making data from different sources complement each other as well
                    as using the existing data to create new data.
